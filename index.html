            <h2>Failures of tech in education in developing countries</h2>

            <p>No Laptop Left Behind details the issues behind technology driven education efforts 
                in low income countries. The main conclusion drawn being that while supplying internet 
                and devices to schools can help it will not do anything without solving more deep rooted 
                underlying issues such as lack of motivated teachers and administrators as well as extreme 
                lack of funds or support staff to keep the devices running. Technology driven education 
                efforts are nothing new, other past methods detailed include using radio to broadcast 
                lessons from some of the world's top teachers and professors to “bring the world to the 
                classroom”. Another effort in the 1950s included television, “
                John F. Kennedy convinced Congress to authorize $32 million  for classroom television 
                programs”, this led to American Samoa basing its entire school system on televised instruction.
                The problem with these efforts is said to be this, “real education involves two-way 
                interaction, while broadcast media is only one-way”, and while many would like to believe 
                different rigorous studies consistently point otherwise. The primary claim of all the tech 
                driven efforts being that if students are given access to devices then their naturally 
                curious minds will use it to learn, though that has been difficult to prove with more
                sources citing that students are more likely to use them for games or entertainment 
                over any learning software. These devices need training and guidance for them to be
                of any use and in a system where the teachers do not care and do not have the support
                staff to keep devices running the tech ends up helping no one. </p>

            <h2>Primary issue with lack of support staff</h2>
            <p>Seth Youngstrom<br>

            <p>	The hope behind device integration into classrooms is that it makes education better for 
                students and teachers alike, however it ends up making the jobs for already exhausted teaching 
                staff harder. Adding unreliable computers to the equations meant that “teachers have to design
                 lesson plans involving computers, they also had to write low-tech backup plans in case of 
                technology failures”. Without critical IT and training professionals to ensure that the 
                computers given would function and the teachers would be able to effectively use them then 
                they became a liability. Teachers were forced to come up with contingency plans, likely 
                weakening both the high and low tech lessons as less time was spent on each one. A large 
                part of using any teaching tool in a classroom relies on consistency and reliability.  
                Computers in a high humidity, hot and dirty environment are prone to breaking and schools 
                cannot afford to have IT staff on constant employment to fix these issues so much of the 
                tools they are given to teach cannot be properly relied on. Technology cannot be unloaded 
                into schools without addressing more base systematic issues and expect positive results, 
                or any at all. </p>
